Beautiful, interesting space, looks out onto garden. Has its own covered patio entrance, shielded from quiet tree-lined street, with zero crime statistics. Bike to Multnomah Village, ten minute drive to Hillsdale/Costco/ New Seasons, fifteen minutes to PCC Sylvania/OHSU/Lewis and Clark. #45 bus stops two blocks away. ~ 15 ft x 20 ft main room connects via short flight of stairs and landing to a tiny kitchen with a *half-sized* fridge, and through there to a large bathroom with a Jacuzzi-jet tub. Big, south-facing windows, nooks, ledges and an alcove make the  (~ 450 sq ft) space efficient. There&apos;s also partially finished crawlspace adjoining the kitchen, accessible via step-stool, for storage. Includes three Ikea storage units, a small dresser and a fold-out desk/table with chair. Personal washer and dryer in the garage, abundant street parking. $900 rent includes utilities and fast WiFi. Large, shared back yard will occasionally be roamed by two miniature dachshunds and owner, who lives and works in the house above. No cats or smoking allowed. A calm, small dog just might be.  References and background/credit check. Six-month lease. First month&apos;s rent and $1100 deposit to move in. Map location is approximate.<br>\n<br>\nA note about the tall black thing in the kitchen photos: This is a spiral staircase and sort of a giant, obstacle, but it does provide  shelving and visual interest, if you&apos;re into it. The landing at the top offers additional storage. Via the landing the staircase leads to the house above, but there&apos;s a door at the top that is kept deadlocked.  <br>\n<br>\nNote you&apos;re more likely to hear back if you don&apos;t just jump to asking if you can see the place, but instead tell me a little about your need for a place to live, whether you&apos;ll have references about being able to afford the rent, and on being trustworthy and a good tenant/neighbor. If you have an exceptional small dog you&apos;ll be wanting an exception for, please mention that up front, and consider whether a past landlord could vouch for your dog&apos;s own qualities as a tenant and housemate. Note single occupancy is recommended for the size and design of this place, as well as preferred and factored into the price. <br>\n<br>\nP.S. This is a relisting and let me apologize if I did not respond to your inquiry or otherwise dropped the ball a couple weeks ago. I&apos;d thought it would be available and view-able sooner, then later and now it should be available Aug 1. The current tenant mostly has his things boxed and says they&apos;ll be gone tonight or tomorrow.    ",
